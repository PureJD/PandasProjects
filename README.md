# State guessing game
### This is a game that uses the Turtle library and Pandas library in order to create an educational game in which the user attempts to guess the states in the US. The game functions in this order;
#### -The screen is drawn using the Turtle class
#### -The map of the US is drawn using an image
#### -Using Pandas the data is extracted from the CSV file which contains all states and coordinates. 
#### -The states are added to a list in order to be edited.
#### -The coordinates are added to a dictionary. 
#### -As the user is prompted to make a guess, the guess is checked against the library and if it matches an unpicked state, an object will draw the states name on the map.
#### -The picked state is then removed from the list. 
#### -If all states are selected the game issues a winning message. If the user types exit, a new CSV file is created containing all the states the use failed to remember.
